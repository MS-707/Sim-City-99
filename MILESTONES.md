# SimCity 99 — Milestone Queue

Worked top-to-bottom. Each milestone is completed against success criteria
defined by an independent reviewer agent before implementation starts.
Queue policy: keep at least 5 open improvements at all times.

## In progress

- [ ] **M10 — Day/night cycle**: gradual day-night tint over the city, lit
  building windows at night, street lamps along roads, toggleable in Speed
  menu; disasters more dramatic in the dark.

## Open

- [ ] **M11 — Bigger maps & map picker**: selectable map sizes (64/80/128) and
  a terrain-preview picker on the splash screen with reroll button.
- [ ] **M12 — Seasons**: month-driven seasonal palette (snowy winters, autumn
  forests), seasonal ticker flavor, snow plows/reduced traffic in winter.
- [ ] **M13 — Bonds & loans**: issue municipal bonds from the budget window
  (borrow now, repay with interest monthly), credit rating that reacts to
  treasury health; advisors comment on debt.
- [ ] **M14 — Postcard photo mode**: export a framed PNG "postcard from
  1997" snapshot of the current view (city name, date, retro border).
- [ ] **M15 — Touch & small-screen support**: tap-to-build, pinch zoom,
  responsive toolbar/side panel so the game plays on tablets.
- [ ] **M16 — More scenarios & medals**: extend the M9 SCENARIOS table with
  2-3 more scripted challenges (e.g. "Blackout Summer": rebuild a grid after
  the '97 heat wave; "Y2K Ready": bunker the city before Dec 1999), plus
  bronze/silver/gold results by finish date and a trophy shelf dialog.

## Done

- [x] **M9 — Scenario mode**: declarative SCENARIOS table (js/scenarios.js)
  with two playable scenarios — "Gridlock '97" (deterministic pre-built
  945-zone metropolis, win by cutting jammed road tiles to ≤8 before Jan
  1999) and "Twister Season" (scripted bimonthly tornadoes for a year, grow
  to pop 4000 by Jan 2000) — Win95 scenario cards on the splash, goal
  presented via the Bugle at start, live progress + months-left in a status
  bar cell, once-only win/lose front pages (latched, checked only on month
  rollover), sandbox continue after either outcome, scenario state in save
  round-trip, free play untouched. Verified against 7 criteria (58 checks,
  all pass; mean tick 0.62ms in the heaviest scenario).

- [x] **M8 — Public deploy**: single-file bundle (all CSS/JS inlined, zero
  external requests) published as a Claude Artifact and linked from the
  README; bundle smoke-tested headlessly (game boots, 200 ticks, all M1-M7
  features present, zero console errors).

- [x] **M7 — Time capsule events**: declarative EVENTS table (5 dated events
  1997–1999: heat wave, Asian financial flu, dot-com boom, GoldenEye tourism
  blip, Y2K panic with Jan-2000 resolution paper), once-only firing on month
  rollover, measurable A/B sim effects (demand/funds/power), scheduled
  expiry, save v3 round-trip (firedEvents/activeMods), no retro-firing on
  late-started cities. Verified against 8 criteria (all pass; 984-tick
  1997→2000 soak clean).

- [x] **M6 — Audio & UI polish**: zoom-in ambient soundscapes (traffic hum,
  industrial clank, gulls, stadium crowd) viewport-selective and gated on
  zoom/sfx/visibility with rate limits; "Budget report monthly" auto-popup
  toggle persisted in localStorage; F1 shortcut overlay generated live from
  TOOLS. Verified against 7 criteria (all pass, no SFX regressions).

- [x] **M5 — Nicer terrain**: 16-mask sand shoreline transitions (roadMask
  pattern), 3-frame animated water cycled by the render frame counter (no
  per-frame allocation), cluster-aware forest density sprites (3×3 variants,
  deterministic per seed), §50 waterfill tool with live shoreline re-masking.
  Verified against 7 criteria (all pass).

- [x] **M4 — Advisors panel**: #dlg-advisors Win95 dialog (Windows menu) with
  three Win95-style tabs — Myrna Plutz (Finance), Chief Gus Ramirez (Safety),
  Dr. Willow Greenfield (Environment) — procedural canvas portraits, 3+
  threshold rules per advisor reading live sim state, 500ms live refresh even
  while paused, draggable/closable. Verified against 7 criteria (all pass).

- [x] **M3 — More building variety**: school and hospital as placeable 2×2
  civics with powered education/health coverage maps (stampCoverage, radius
  14); coverage raises land value, boosts citywide demand and gates the jump
  to zone level 3, with A/B-verified growth impact; Education/Health rows in
  the Inspect dialog + a Services minimap mode; zone sprite variants expanded
  from 3 to 5 per level (45 developed-zone sprites). Verified against 8
  criteria (all pass, mean tick 0.14ms).

- [x] **M2 — City milestones & rewards**: 5 population tiers
  (Settlement → Village → Town → City → Metropolis) with monotonic promotion
  ratchet, 1997-tabloid newspaper popup on promotion, tier-gated reward
  buildings (Mayor's House at Town, Stadium at City) with sim effects, rank
  in title bar, save-format v2 round-trip. Verified against 7 criteria.
- [x] **M1 — Traffic simulation**: per-road congestion from zone trip
  generation; congestion lowers land value and growth; traffic minimap
  overlay; animated cars on roads. Verified against 8 criteria (all pass,
  mean tick 0.12ms).

- [x] **M0 — Core game** (v1): iso engine, RCI sim, power grid, budget,
  disasters, Win95 UI, 1997 ticker, synth audio, save/load.
